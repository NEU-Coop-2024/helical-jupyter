This solution is incomplete, I was unable to avoid the use of built-in magics to load the custom cell magic into a Juptyer notebook. 
However, this solution is more preferable than navigating to the script’s path within the notebook, as the user does not have to know the location of the script to load it into a Jupyter notebook. 
I will continue to look for a solution that meets the requirements.

Download the EchoPackage folder and run the pip install . command from the command line in the aforementioned folder.
Open a Jupyter notebook and create a cell with %load_ext EchoCellMagic.EchoCellMagic to initialize the custom cell magic
In a different cell, use the %%echo_append command along with a print statement
